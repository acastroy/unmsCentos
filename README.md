Workaround for Ubiquiti UNMS on Centos

Out of the box UNMS (which is really cool by the way, is only supported on Debian/Ubuntu variants) is not supported on Centos/Redhat Variants.

In terminal do:

sudo su -

Chmod +x the install.sh and run using ./install.sh

The unms installer fails due to the docker service not being available during its install script - I wrote this simple hacky script to enable the unms installer to continue.

The only interaction required is to say yes or no when you get the prompt:

"Our distribution 'Centos 7' is not supported. We recommend that you install UNMS on Ubuntu 16.04, Debian 8 or newer. Would you like to continue with the installation anyway? [y/N]"
